"Smart School Canteen Queue"

Step 1: 
The main problem is that too much students that try to line up, and the students take too much time to order what they want. There is also no way to track which food item isn't available and which is available. This makes ordering an item that wasn't available a hassle.

Step 2:
1. Students take too long to decide what to order.
2. Cashiers manually calculate totals and give change.
3. There is no system to track food stock.
4. There is no way to know what time the canteen is available.

Step 3:

Sub - Problem                           Ct Skill                     Example Solution
1. Students take too long    Abstraction: simplify the ordering      Add a menu/QR code
to decide what to order.     process by hiding the unnecessary       menu outside the line
                             complexity                              so students know what
                                                                     to order

2. Cashiers manually         Algorithm design: create a step by      Add a machine that the
calculate totals and give    step automated process                  students will simply
change.                                                              insert their money in
                                                                     and it will give their change

3. There is no system        Decomposition - break inventory         Add a TV screen that
to track food stock.         into trackable units                    will show which items
                                                                     are in stock.

4. There is no way to        Decomposition: analyze data over        Add a sign outside
know what time the canteen   time to find trends                     the canteen door that
is available.                                                        shows what time the
                                                                     canteen is open.
```

Step 4: 
```text
START

DISPLAY menu with prices
SET total = 0

WHILE student is still ordering
    DISPLAY "Select item or press DONE"
    INPUT item_choice

    IF item_choice == "DONE"
        BREAK
    ELSE
        GET price of item_choice
        SET total = total + price
        DISPLAY "Item added. Current total: " + total
    ENDIF
END WHILE

DISPLAY "Total amount due: " + total
INPUT amount_paid

IF amount_paid < total
    DISPLAY "Insufficient payment. Please pay the remaining balance."
ELSE
    SET change = amount_paid - total
    DISPLAY "Your change is: " + change
ENDIF

PRINT receipt (items, total, amount_paid, change)

END
```

Step 5:
Start → Display Menu → Loop: Select Item → Add to Total → Ask "More items?" → (Yes: loop back / No: exit loop) → Display Total → Input Payment → Decision: Is Payment ≥ Total? → (No: show insufficient message / Yes: calculate & display change) → Print Receipt → End
